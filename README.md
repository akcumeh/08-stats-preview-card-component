## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Bootstrap 5.1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/)

### What I learned

I had an issue with overlaying the image with color like in the designs. Fortunately I was shown a way to do it by a fellow Frontend Mentor user.

### Continued development

I find Bootstrap to be a very useful framework so I'm going to keep practicing more with it.
I'm also going to keep making websites that are as accessible as possible.
